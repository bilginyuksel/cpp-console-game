- create activity lifecycle's for an object
You can create protected lifecycle methods for each object you have created.
This event's can be overriden by users.
Example;

onInputCaptured() {

}
onPositionChanged(){

}
onCollision(){

}
onStart(){

}
onUpdate(){

}
onDestroy(){
    
}
onPyshics() {

}

- Do all of these check's inside renderer update function.
- If user wants to customize it. The user can override the renderer update function
and all of these lifecycle's can be overriden.
